### Distributed Sensing Scenario

This example describes a distributed sensors system with two sensors (K=2). Each sensor device captures a fraction (μ) of the speech signal from the source. In this example, μ is less than 0.5, meaning that the two devices combined cannot fully capture the entire speech signal.
